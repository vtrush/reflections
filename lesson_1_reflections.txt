How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff results showed what was changed and since old version worked then the bug was easy to identify.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It's easy to see all the changes that was made by anybody and review code in order to identify bugs or incorrect changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    More flexibility.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is created to coding and changing multiple files for a logical change makes sense, while Google Docs save documents that unrelated.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can see all the revisions and see what was changed.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can see all the changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Commit changes.
